# VexScript
A programming language that I made with the purpose of being similar to JavaScript, but better.

Notes:
  - The language is FAR from being complete. It's just barely a usable language at the moment.
  - The langauge is going to include static typing and therefore should be faster than JavaScript. But I implemented it's runtime in JavaScript which has resulted in VexScript running like 1000x slower than JavaScript (which is very very slow).
