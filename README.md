# VexScript
A programming language that I made with the purpose of being similar to JavaScript, but better.

Notes:
  - The language is FAR from being complete. It's just barely a usable language at the moment.
  - The language is going to include static typing and therefore should be faster than JavaScript however at the moment it's about 1000x slower.
  - I implemented it's runtime in JavaScript which happens to be very very slow, but in the future I will rewrite VexScript's runtime in C++ which should make it a lot faster than JS.
